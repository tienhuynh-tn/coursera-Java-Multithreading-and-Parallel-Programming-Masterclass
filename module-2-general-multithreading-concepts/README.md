# Module 2: General Multithreading Concepts

**Duration:** 30 minutes  
**Content:** 5 Videos  
**Objective:** Establish foundational knowledge of multithreading in Java, with emphasis on differences between 
processes and threads, execution models, and Amdahl's Law.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes

- Differentiate between processes and threads
- Understand how Java handles multithreading at a conceptual level
- Explore execution models: parallel, concurrent, asynchronous, and non-blocking
- Apply Amdahlâ€™s Law to evaluate performance scaling with multithreading

## ðŸŽ¬ Video Content (30 minutes)

1. **What Is a Process?** â€“ 7 minutes *(Preview available)*  
   Explains operating system-level processes and their lifecycle.

2. **What Is a Thread?** â€“ 4 minutes  
   Introduces threads, their structure, and importance in Java applications.

3. **Threads Versus Processes** â€“ 10 minutes  
   Comparative analysis to understand when to use each and their impact on performance.

4. **Parallel vs Concurrent vs Asynchronous vs Non-Blocking** â€“ 5 minutes  
   Clarifies terminology and models that are often confused in real-world systems.

5. **Amdahl's Law** â€“ 3 minutes  
   Evaluates the theoretical speedup limits of parallel systems.

## ðŸ“Ž Notes

This module builds essential vocabulary and context needed for deeper exploration of Java concurrency. Take notes, 
especially on the execution models, as they influence real-world design choices in high-performance systems.
